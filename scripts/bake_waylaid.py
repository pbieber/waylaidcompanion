"""Bake what Pugger Waylaid Companion recorded in game into the addon's shipped data.

Reads every account's SavedVariables/PuggerWaylaidCompanion.lua in the WoW Forever client
(read-only), merges it with what is already in Data/Recorded.lua,
and rewrites that file:

  - where each Craftsman's Writ is handed in (an NPC, or a map spot nobody has named yet);
  - the Merchant's Favor each sealed crate paid.

No writ is ever dropped: one already in Recorded.lua stays unless the saved data knows
better (an NPC's name for what was only a spot, or a spot the addon has since moved to the
zone it really lies in).

    python scripts/bake_waylaid.py [--wow "C:/Program Files (x86)/World of Warcraft"] [--dry-run]

Needs lupa (pip install lupa) to read the Lua files.
